# Doing a PhD
* do some or all of:
    * Build some stuff (e.g. new multimedia FS)
    * Measure some stuff (e.g. power use on laptop)
    * Evaluate some stuff (e.g. performance of new web server scheduling algorithm)
    * Analyze some stuff (e.g. queuing theoretic model of the Internet)
* Write a dissertation
* Submit and get viva’d – scary!


# Risks
* Treat PhD like high school
* Ask supervisor what to do
    * Don’t understand it
    * Don’t agree with it
    * But do it anyway
* Finish task and wait for next task
    * Play CSGO or do consultancy in meantime
* Write nothing, read nothing Repeat until PhD deadline and realize
* You don’t have a thesis; or You have a thesis you don’t understand


# Choosing a Topic
* Don’t have to fix on this on day one!
    * Do some stuff, work with others, write some papers, and then choose
    * 6 – 18 months is fine
* How to choose something?
    * Read a paper you hate – decide to fix it
    * Read a paper you love – join effort
    * Discover a problem – aim to solve it
    * “Scrabble” – invent something


# Better Strategies
* Work with others from day one
* From 1 year in, aim to have a current “draft” of your PhD in your head
* Do something every month
    * Read + critique a bunch of papers
    * Write some code
    * Do some measurements
    * Write down results, designs, ideas, …
* Dual-task if at all possible: left brain / right brain parallelism
* PhD itself typically in-depth: You become the expert at something
    * But your time on the PhD program should cover more than this:
        * Work with others (& in other areas)
        * Internships particularly valuable
    * Post doctoral jobs typically favor a broader outlook (too narrow == bad!)



# Critical Thinking - Reading
* Do I like it? Hate it? (opinion)

* What problem is it trying to solve?

* How does their approach differ from previous ones?

* (how much previous work do I know about – read it! (reference chaining))

* Does it work?

* What could be improved?


# Critical Thinking - Writing
Consider a paper (or your thesis) as an argument
* What is the problem?

* If not well known, why is it a problem?

* Why are all previous approaches insufficient (broken / wrong / stupid)?

* What is your approach?

    * how does it work?

    * how well does it work?

    * how does it improve on previous attempts?

# Managing your Supervisor
* Extreme #1: "The Gauleiter": He or she has an idea and/or plan & Your job is to carry this out
    * Pros: Should be clear what to do & Can make progress from day 1
    * Cons: Little opportunity for creative thought & May feel lack of control or ownership
    * Strategy: read, think & argue
* Extreme #2: "The Don": Vaguely interested in everything & Expects you to come up with an idea, and then go off and do something good (but may not mention this)
    * Pros: Lots of flexibility and options & Lots of positive feedback from supervisor
    * Cons: Easy to get stuck, or lost & Feedback may be vague or esoteric (low usefulness)
    * Strategy: Attempt to engage him/her concretely in your work & Impress with your own erudition / intelligence
* Key point: it is your responsibility to make your supervisor work for you & You’re the one who wants to get the PhD
    * General Strategies: Have relatively frequent meetings & Aim for concrete deliverables (e.g. whiteboard design, or draft paper) & Educate: be[come] the expert on your topic  & Learn to argue/discuss/explain

# Aim to Publish
* Work with others
* Get feedback: Reviewers are often smart and dedicated

# How to Publish
* Start by writing down something
    * Starting point usually either “stuff I’ve done” or “thing I believe”
        * “Stuff I’ve done” – first write a tech report which just describes it
        * Add `blank’ related work section
        * Retro-fit argument of some sort
        * Give to peers / supervisor / others, get feedback, modify, repeat, …
        * Submit to appropriate workshop / conference (with proximate deadline)
* Start with an idea / belief
    * Write out skeleton argument
    * Critique related work
    * Work out what you need to actually do to back up your argument, and then
        * Sketch out solution in paper, run past peers / supervisor / others, submit position paper
        * And/or start to do actual work
            * Add details / results etc as you go

# Reasons for Paper Rejection
* Paper not clearly written (at a word / sentence / paragraph level)
* Paper not clearly written (at a structural / argument level)
* Paper clearly written, but:
    * argument is weak / false; or
    * solution is obvious / incorrect; or
    * experiments (or analysis) are poor
    * PC are biased idiots

# Writing up
* Need to write a dissertation which supports your PhD thesis
* typically 30-60K words:
    * Longest document you’ll have ever written
    * Hard to ensure a single “story” throughout
    * Core (“meat”) usually 1—3 chapters
        * E.g. design, implementation, eval
        * E.g. technique1, technique2, technique3
    * Produce drafts and get frequent feedback
* Expect 6-12 months just for write-up!
